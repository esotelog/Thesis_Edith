\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.


\indent I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Gibson, for his guidance and scientific insight throughout this process. I am also grateful with the Department of Geology and Geophysics for providing financial support through teaching assistanship to complete the degree.

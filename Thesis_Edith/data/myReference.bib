	Abstract = {Fracture mechanics has established itself as an important discipline of growing interest to those working to assess the safety, reliability and service life of engineering structures and materials. In order to calculate the loading situation at cracks and defects, nowadays numerical techniques like finite element method (FEM) have become indispensable tools for a broad range of applications. The present monograph provides an introduction to the essential concepts of fracture mechanics, its main goal being to procure the special techniques for FEM analysis of crack problems, which have to date only been mastered by experts. All kinds of static, dynamic and fatigue fracture problems are treated in two- and three-dimensional elastic and plastic structural components. The usage of the various solution techniques is demonstrated by means of sample problems selected from practical engineering case studies. The primary target group includes graduate students, researchers in academia and engineers in practice.

	Abstract = {Carbonate rocks are deposited in the Ordovician, Cambrian, and Sinian of eastern Tarim Basin with a cumulative maximum thickness exceeding 2000 m. They are the main carriers of oil and gas, and a great deal of natural gas has been found there in the past five years. Based on lithofacies and reservoir differences, natural gas exploration domains of eastern Tarim Basin can be classified into five types: Ordovician platform limestone; Ordovician platform dolomite; Cambrian platform margin mound shoal; Cambrian slope gravity flow deposits, and; Sinian dolomite. Carbonate reservoir characteristics of all the types were synthetically analyzed through observation on drilling core and thin sections, porosity and permeability measurement, and logging data of over 10 drilling wells. We find distribution of part of good fracture and cave reservoir in carbonate platform limestone of Ordovician. In the Ordovician, platform facies dolomite is better than limestone, and in the Cambrian, platform margin mound shoal dolomite has large stacking thickness. Good quality and significantly thick carbonate gravity deposit flow can be found in the Cambrian slope, and effective reservoir has also been found in Sinian dolomite. Commercial gas has been found in the limestone and dolomite of Ordovician in Shunnan and Gucheng areas. Exploration experiences from these two areas are instructive, enabling a deeper understanding of this scene.},

	Abstract = {Purely numerical methods based on finite-element approximation of the acoustic or elastic wave equation are becoming increasingly popular for the generation of synthetic seismograms. We present formulas for the grid dispersion and stability criteria for some popular finite-element methods (FEM) for wave propagation, namely, classical and spectral FEM. We develop an approach based on a generalized eigenvalue formulation to analyze the dispersive behavior of these FEMs for acoustic or elastic wave propagation that overcomes difficulties caused by irregular node spacing within the element and the use of high-order polynomials, as is the case for spectral FEM. Analysis reveals that for spectral FEM of order four or greater, dispersion is less than 0.2{\%} at four to five nodes per wavelength, and dispersion is not angle dependent. New results can be compared with grid-dispersion results of some classical finite-difference methods (FDM) used for acoustic or elastic wave propagation. Analysis reveals that FDM and ...},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional scattering of elastic waves in a medium containing a circular heterogeneity is investigated with an analytical solution and numerical wave propagation simulations. Different combinations of finite difference methods (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM) are used to numerically solve the elastodynamic wave equations. Finite difference and finite element techniques are applied to approximate both the time and space derivatives and are combined in various ways to provide different numerical algorithms for modeling elastic wave propagation. The results of the different numerical algorithms are compared for simulations of an incident plane P-wave that is scattered by a mechanically weak circular inclusion whereby the diameter of the inclusion is of the same order than the P-wave's wavelength. For this scattering problem an analytical solution is available and used as the reference solution in the comparison of the different numerical algorithms. Staircase-like spatial discretization of the inclusion's circular shape with the finite difference method using a rectangular grid provides accurate velocity and displacement fields close to the inclusion boundary only for very high spatial resolutions. Implicit time integration based on either finite differences or finite elements does not provide computational advantages compared to explicit schemes. The best numerical algorithm in terms of accuracy and computation time for the investigated scattering problem consists of a finite element method in space using an unstructured mesh combined with an explicit finite difference method in time. The computational advantages and disadvantages of the different numerical algorithms are discussed.},

The discontinuous Galerkin method can be used on polyhedral meshes; thus, it is easy to handle the complex surfaces in the models. However, this approach is computationally intense in comparison with finite differences. Finite differences are computationally efficient, but in general, they require rectangular grids, leading to the stair-step approximation of the interfaces, which causes strong diffraction of the wavefield. In this research we present a hybrid algorithm where the discontinuous Galerkin method is used in a relatively small upper part of the model and finite differences are applied to the main part of the model.},

@article{Gibson2014,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACTConventional finite-difference methods produce accurate solutions to the acoustic and elastic wave equation for many applications, but they face significant challenges when material properties vary significantly over distances less than the grid size. This challenge is likely to occur in reservoir characterization studies, because important reservoir heterogeneity can be present on scales of several meters to ten meters. Here, we describe a new multiscale finite-element method for simulating acoustic wave propagation in heterogeneous media that addresses this problem by coupling fine- and coarse-scale grids. The wave equation is solved on a coarse grid, but it uses basis functions that are generated from the fine grid and allow the representation of the fine-scale variation of the wavefield on the coarser grid.

	Abstract = {Many of the current issues and methodologies related to finite element methods for time-harmonic acoustics are reviewed. The effective treatment of unbounded domains is a major challenge. Most prominent among the approaches that have been developed for this purpose are absorbing boundary conditions, infinite elements, and absorbing layers. Standard computational methods are unable to cope with wave phenomena at short wave lengths due to resolutions required to control dispersion and pollution errors, leading to prohibitive computational demands. Since computation naturally separates the scales of a problem according to the mesh size, multiscale considerations provide a useful framework for viewing these difficulties and developing methods to counter them. Other issues addressed are related to the efficient solution of systems of specialized algebraic equations, and inverse problems of acoustics. The tremendous progress that has been made in all of the above areas in recent years will surely continue, leading to many more exciting developments.},

The motivation for our study comes from detecting a cavity that might be caused by an underground nuclear explosion. This is relevant to on-site inspections, an element of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The waveform modeling we address is implemented in the frequency domain; i.e., we consider the wavefield as well as the source to be time harmonic. We numerically investigate the cases in which the source of the scattered field is either a plane wave from the bottom or the side as from passive sources, such as teleseismic waves or ambient noise, or a spherical wave from the surface as from an active point source, such as a vibroseis or an explosion. To this end, we split the total field in an incident and an unknown scattered field to understand the effects more explicitly.

This will require solutions to near-surface challenges, such as energy penetration, scattering, source-generated noise, surface-generated multiples, statics, and source and receiver coupling. Solutions to these problems will become possible due to advances in seismic acquisition, including simultaneous source acquisition and wireless seismic-driven ultrahigh channel systems.

	Abstract = {It is important to develop fast yet accurate numerical methods for seismic wave propagation to characterize complex geological structures and oil and gas reservoirs. However, the computational cost of conventional numerical modeling methods, such as finite-difference method and finite-element method, becomes prohibitively expensive when applied to very large models. We propose a Generalized Multiscale Finite-Element Method (GMsFEM) for elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous, anisotropic media, where we construct basis functions from multiple local problems for both the boundaries and interior of a coarse node support or coarse element. The application of multiscale basis functions can capture the fine scale medium property variations, and allows us to greatly reduce the degrees of freedom that are required to implement the modeling compared with conventional finite-element method for wave equation, while restricting the error to low values. We formulate the continuous Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the multiscale method, both of which have pros and cons. Applications of the multiscale method to three heterogeneous models show that our multiscale method can effectively model the elastic wave propagation in anisotropic media with a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom in the modeling system.},

The propagator matrices can be found using the boundary element method. The model can have irregular boundaries, including arbitrary free-surface topography. Any number of karsts can be included in the model, and each karst can be of arbitrary geometric shape. We have used the Burton-Miller formulation to tackle the numerical instability caused by the fictitious resonance due to the finite size of a karstic void. Our method was implemented in the frequency-space domain, so frequency-dependent Q can be readily incorporated. We have validated our calculation by comparing it with the analytical solution for a cylindrical void and to the spectral element method for a more complex model. This new modeling capability is useful in many important applications in seismic inverse theory, such as imaging karsts, caves, sinkholes, and clandestine tunnels.},

	Abstract = {The paper addresses the properties of finite element solutions for the Helmholtz equation. The h-version of the finite element method with piecewise linear approximation is applied to a one-dimensional model problem. New results are shown on stability and error estimation of the discrete model. In all propositions, assumptions are made on the magnitude of hk only, where k is the wavelength and h is the stepwidth of the FE-mesh. Previous analytical results had been shown with the assumption that k2h is small. For medium and high wavenumber, these results do not cover the meshsizes that are applied in practical applications. The main estimate reveals that the error in H1-norm of discrete solutions for the Helmholtz equation is polluted when k2h is not small. The error is then not quasioptimal; i.e., the relation of the FE-error to the error of best approximation generally depends on the wavenumber k. It is noted that the pollution term in the relative error is of the same order as the phase lead of the numerical solution. In the result of this analysis, thorough and rigorous understanding of error behavior throughout the range of convergence is gained. Numerical results are presented that show sharpness of the error estimates and highlight some phenomena of the discrete solution behavior. The h-p-version of the FEM is studied in Part II.},

@article{Schmicker2014,
	Abstract = {From a computational point of view, the numerical analysis of ultrasonic guided waves is still a very demanding task. Because of the high-frequency regime both a fine spatial and temporal discretization is required. To minimize the numerical costs, efficient and robust algorithms ought to be developed. One promising idea is therefore to focus on high-order finite element methods (ho-FEM). The current article investigates the behavior of the p-version of the finite element method (p-FEM) and the spectral element method (SEM) with respect to the existence of spurious oscillations in the solution. Convergence stud-ies have shown that it is possible to observe non-physical oscillations under certain conditions. These parasitic vibrations, however, significantly deteriorate the accuracy of the simulation. For this reason, we analyse this phe-nomenon in detail and propose solutions to avoid its occurrence. Without loss of generality, we employ a two-dimensional plane strain model to derive a guideline as to how to avoid these spurious oscillations, placing a special emphasis on the relation between the element size, the polyno-mial degree of the high-order shape functions and the excitation frequency. Our results show that accurate simulations are possible if the model is generated according to the proposed methodology. Moreover, the implementation of the guideline into an existing finite element software is straightfor-ward; these properties turn the method into a useful tool for practical wave propagation analyses.},

Here we address the q-convergence of the method, where q is the number of plane waves added at each vertex, for the class of smooth (analytic) solutions for which we get better than exponential convergence for sufficiently small h depending on p. An important observation is that we can monitor the accuracy in any computed solution quantity of interest at negligible cost by using q-extrapolation. Our results assume exact integration of all the employed integrals. Further studies are needed to analyze the effects of the numerical integrations, and also the effect of the roundoff errors.},

We employ multiscale methods using limited global information since the permeability fields do not have apparent scale separation. The proposed approach does not require any interpolation in stochastic space and can easily be coupled with interpolation-based approaches to predict the solution on the coarse grid.

The standard finite element spaces are augmented by adding special functions which reflect the known information about the boundary value problem and the input data; e.g., the singular functions obtained from the local asymptotic expansion of the exact solution in the neighborhood of a corner point, etc. The special functions are multiplied with the partition of unity corresponding to the standard linear vertex shape-functions and pasted together with the existing finite element basis to construct an augmented conforming finite element space. In this way, the local approximability afforded by the special functions is included in the approximation, while maintaining the existing infrastructure of finite element codes. The major features of the GFEM are: (1) the essential boundary conditions can be imposed exactly as in the standard FEM, unlike other partition of unity based methods where this is a major issue; (2) the accuracy of the numerical integration of the entries of the stiffness matrix and load vector is controlled adaptively so that the errors in integration of the special functions do not affect the accuracy of the constructed approximation (this issue also has not been sufficiently addressed in other implementations of partition of unity or meshless methods); and (3) linear dependencies in the system of equations are resolved by employing an easy modification of the direct linear solver. The power of the GFEM for solving problems in domains with complex geometry with less error and less computer resources than the standard FEM is illustrated by numerical examples.},

	Abstract = {Paleokarst refers to karstic (dissolution-related) features formed in the past, related to an earlier hydrological system or landsurface. Karst is a term used to describe distinctive terrains whose landforms and hydrology result from a combination of high rock solubility and well-developed secondary porosity. Karst systems have been intensively studied and the hydrological principles of their formation are well understood. Thus, in studying paleokarsts, it is possible to employ the knowledge of present-day systems to understand ancient ones. Indeed this is one of the few occasions when ``diagenesis'' can be related to hydrology and hydrogeology, allowing some predictive element. There are two main drawbacks encountered in studying paleokarsts which frustrate attempts to apply karst-science to interpret them. Firstly, many paleokarsts are encountered in the subsurface, particularly during hydrocarbon exploration, and interpreting paleokarst style from limited seismic or borehole data is very difficult. Recognizing and interpreting paleokarsts in the subsurface is difficult but a variety of techniques can be applied. Modelling a paleokarstic reservoir is particularly difficult and it is likely that some fractured reservoirs may be paleokarstic in origin.},

@article{Komatitsch1998,
	Abstract = {We present the spectral element method to simulate elastic-wave propagation in realistic geological structures involving complieated free-surface topography and material interfaces for two- and three-dimensional geometries. The spectral element method introduced here is a high-order variational method for the spatial approximation of elastic-wave equations. The mass matrix is diagonal by construction in this method, which drastically reduces the computational cost and allows an efficient parallel implementation. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced in variational form to simulate unbounded physical domains. The time discretization is based on an energy-momentum conserving scheme that can be put into a classical explicit-implicit predictor/multi-corrector format. Long-term energy conservation and stability properties are illustrated as well as the efficiency of the absorbing conditions. The associated Courant condition behaves as $\Delta$tC {\textless} O (nel−1/ndN−2), with nel the number of elements, nd the spatial dimension, and N the polynomial order. In practice, a spatial sampling of approximately 5 points per wavelength is found to be very accurate when working with a polynomial degree of N = 8. The accuracy of the method is shown by comparing the spectral element solution to analytical solutions of the classical two-dimensional (2D) problems of Lamb and Garvin. The flexibility of the method is then illustrated by studying more realistic 2D models involving realistic geometries and complex free-boundary conditions. Very accurate modeling of Rayleigh-wave propagation, surface diffraction, and Rayleigh-to-body-wave mode conversion associated with the free-surface curvature are obtained at low computational cost. The method is shown to provide an efficient tool to study the diffraction of elastic waves by three-dimensional (3D) surface topographies and the associated local effects on strong ground motion. Complex amplification patterns, both in space and time, are shown to occur even for a gentle hill topography. Extension to a heterogeneous hill structure is considered. The efficient implementation on parallel distributed memory architectures will allow to perform real-time visualization and interactive physical investigations of 3D amplification phenomena for seismic risk assessment.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on increasing the accuracy of low-order (four-node quadrilateral) finite elements for the transient analysis of wave propagation. Modified integration rules, originally proposed for time-harmonic problems, provide the basis for the proposed technique. The modified integration rules shift the integration points to locations away from the conventional Gauss or Gauss-Lobatto integration points with the goal of reducing the discretization errors, specifically the dispersion error. Presented here is an extension of the idea to time-dependent analysis using implicit as well as explicit time-stepping schemes. The locations of the stiffness integration points remain unchanged from those in time-harmonic case. On the other hand, the locations of the integration points for the mass matrix depend on the time-stepping scheme and the step size. Furthermore, the central difference method needs to be modified from its conventional form to facilitate fully explicit computation. The superior performance...},

We present a Galerkin multiscale finite element method using the global information and provide a convergence analysis when applied to solve the wave equations. We investigate the relation between the smoothness of the global fields and convergence rates of the global Galerkin multiscale finite element method for the wave equations.
